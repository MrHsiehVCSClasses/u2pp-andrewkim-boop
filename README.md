This project is a drugstore: release 0.10
You can choose to "purchase" differing types of drugs at differing prices and amounts
The code will display how much the total cost is
In order to start the program all the user must do is choose the sort of drug that they wish to purchase
Although there are no ways to actually purchase any drugs with currency, that will come in a future patch note
i'm sorry this is so bad i was truly struggling to function when i finished thisx
